Hey there, I’m Safvana 👋
Economist in the making, data storyteller at heart, and someone who believes that every dataset has a story worth telling.

I’ve spent my time diving into the numbers behind big questions — from “How do foreign investments sway India’s exchange rate?” to “What makes the cement industry tick?”. My toolkit blends econometrics, Python, EViews, and a good dose of curiosity.

🛠 What I do

Build and test economic models (Regression, VAR, Granger causality — the fun stuff!)
Turn raw financial data into insights policymakers and businesses can actually use
Mix academic rigor with real-world problem solving

🌱 Currently exploring
